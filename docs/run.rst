Set-up an OGGM run
==================

These examples will show you some example scripts to realise regional or
global runs. The first example can be run on a laptop within a few minutes.
The second example (mass balance calibration) requires more resources but with
a reasonably powerful personal computer you should be OK.

For region-wide or global simulations, we recommend to use a cluster
environment. OGGM should work well on cloud computing services like Amazon
or Google Cloud, too.

Before you start, make sure you had a look at the :ref:`input-data` section.
