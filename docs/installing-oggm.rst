Installing OGGM
===============

OGGM itself is a pure Python package, but it has several dependencies which
are not trivial to install. The instructions below provide all the required
detail and should work on any platform.

OGGM is fully `tested`_ with Python `version`_ 3.6 on Linux and partially
tested on `Windows`_ (Windows should be used for development
purposes only). OGGM doesn't work with Python version 2.7.

.. note::

   Complete beginners should get familiar with Python and its packaging
   ecosystem before trying to install and run OGGM.

For most users we recommend following :ref:`the steps here<conda-install>` to
install Python and the package dependencies with the conda_ package manager.
Linux or Debian users and people with experience with `pip`_ can
:ref:`follow the specific instructions here<virtualenv-install>` to install
with virtualenv.

.. warning::

   If you are using a **Linux Mint** distribution you may want to test if you are affected by the `pyproj bug described here <https://github.com/conda-forge/pyproj-feedstock/issues/10>`_

.. _conda-install:

Install with conda (all platforms)
----------------------------------

This is the recommended way to install OGGM.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You should have a recent version of `git`_ and of the `conda`_ package manager.
You can get `conda`_ by installing `miniconda`_ (the package manager alone -
recommended)  or `anaconda`_ (the full suite - with many packages you won't
need).


**Linux** users should install a couple of Linux packages (not all of them are
required but it's good to have them anyway)::

    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential liblapack-dev gfortran libproj-dev git gdal-bin libgdal-dev netcdf-bin ncview python-netcdf4 ttf-bitstream-vera

.. _git: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
.. _miniconda: http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html
.. _anaconda: http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install


Conda environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend to create a specific `environment`_ for OGGM. In a terminal
window, type::

    conda create --name oggm_env python=3.X


where ``3.X`` is the Python version shipped with conda (currently 3.6).
You can of course use any other name for your environment.

Don't forget to activate it before going on::

    source activate oggm_env

(on Windows: ``activate oggm_env``)

.. _environment: http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html
.. _this problem: https://github.com/conda-forge/geopandas-feedstock/issues/9


Packages
~~~~~~~~

Install the packages from the `conda-forge`_ and ``oggm`` channels::

    conda install -c oggm -c conda-forge oggm-deps

The ``oggm-deps`` package is a "meta package". It does not contain any code but
will install all the packages OGGM needs automatically.

.. warning::

    The `conda-forge`_ channel ensures that the complex package dependencies are
    handled correctly. Subsequent installations or upgrades from the default
    conda channel might brake the chain (see an example `here`_). We strongly
    recommend to **always** use the the `conda-forge`_ channel for your
    installation.

You might consider setting `conda-forge`_ (and ``oggm``) per default, as
suggested on their documentation page::

    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    conda config --add channels oggm
    conda install <package-name>

No scientific Python installation is complete without installing
`IPython`_ and `Jupyter`_::

    conda install -c conda-forge ipython jupyter


.. _conda-forge: https://conda-forge.github.io/
.. _here: https://github.com/ioos/conda-recipes/issues/623
.. _IPython: https://ipython.org/
.. _Jupyter: https://jupyter.org/


OGGM
~~~~

**If you are using conda**, you can install OGGM as a normal conda package::

    conda install -c oggm -c conda-forge oggm

**If you are using pip**, you can install OGGM from `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/oggm>`_::

    pip install oggm


In this case you will be able to use the model but you cannot change its
code.
If you want to explore the code or participate in its
development, we recommend to clone the git repository (or your own fork,
see also :ref:`contributing`)::

    git clone https://github.com/OGGM/oggm.git

Then go to the project root directory::

    cd oggm

And install OGGM in development mode (this is valid for **pip** or **conda**
environments)::

    pip install -e .


.. note::

    Installing OGGM in development mode means that subsequent changes to this
    code repository will be taken into account the next time you will
    ``import oggm``. You can also update OGGM with a simple `git pull`_ from
    the root of the cloned repository.

.. _git pull: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-pull


Testing
~~~~~~~

You are almost there! The last step is to check if everything works as
expected. From the ``oggm`` directory, type::

    pytest .

The tests can run for a couple of minutes. If everything worked fine, you
should see something like::

    =============================== test session starts ===============================

    ==================== 112 passed, 52 skipped in 187.35 seconds =====================


You can safely ignore deprecation warnings and other DLL messages as long as
the tests end without errors.

**Congrats**, you are now set-up for the :ref:`getting-started` section!


.. _virtualenv-install:

Install with virtualenv (Linux/Debian)
--------------------------------------

.. note::

   The installation with virtualenv and pip requires a few more steps than with
   conda. Unless you have a good reason to install by this route,
   :ref:`installing with conda <conda-install>` is probably what you want to do.

The instructions below are for Debian / Ubuntu / Mint systems only!

Linux packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run the following commands to install required packages.

For the build::

    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential python-pip liblapack-dev gfortran libproj-dev python-setuptools

For matplolib::

    $ sudo apt-get install tk-dev python3-tk python3-dev

For GDAL::

    $ sudo apt-get install gdal-bin libgdal-dev python-gdal

For NetCDF::

    $ sudo apt-get install netcdf-bin ncview python-netcdf4


Virtual environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next follow these steps to set up a virtual environment.

Install extensions to virtualenv::

    $ sudo apt-get install virtualenvwrapper

Reload your profile::

    $ source /etc/profile

Make a new environment, for example called ``oggm_env``, with **Python 3**::

    $ mkvirtualenv oggm_env -p /usr/bin/python3

(Further details can be found for example in `this tutorial <http://simononsoftware.com/virtualenv-tutorial-part-2/>`_.)


Python packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Be sure to be on the working environment::

    $ workon oggm_env

Update pip (important!)::

    $ pip install --upgrade pip

Install some packages one by one::

   $ pip install numpy scipy pandas shapely matplotlib

Installing **GDAL** is not so straightforward. First, check which version of
GDAL is installed on your Linux system::

    $ gdal-config --version

The package version (e.g. ``2.2.0``, ``2.3.1``, ...) should match
that of the Python package you want to install. For example, if the Linux
GDAL version is ``2.2.0``, install the latest corresponding Python version.
The following command works on any system and automatically gets the right version::

    $ pip install gdal=="$(gdal-config --version)" --install-option="build_ext" --install-option="$(gdal-config --cflags | sed 's/-I/--include-dirs=/')"

Fiona also builds upon GDAL, so let's compile it the same way::

    $ pip install fiona --install-option="build_ext" --install-option="$(gdal-config --cflags | sed 's/-I/--include-dirs=/')"

(Details can be found in `this blog post <http://tylerickson.blogspot.co.at/2011/09/installing-gdal-in-python-virtual.html>`_.)

Now install further dependencies::

    $ pip install pyproj rasterio Pillow geopandas netcdf4 scikit-image configobj joblib xarray boto3 progressbar2 pytest motionless dask bottleneck

Finally, install the salem and python-colorspace libraries::

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/fmaussion/salem.git
    $ pip install git+https://github.com/retostauffer/python-colorspace.git

OGGM and tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Refer to the sections `OGGM`_ and `Testing`_ above.
