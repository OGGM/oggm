.. _apiglobaltasks:

Global tasks
============

Global tasks are tasks which are run on a set of glaciers (most often: all
glaciers in the current run). They are not parallelizable at the user level
but might use multiprocessing internally.

.. _glacierdir:

Glacier directories
===================

Glacier directories (see also: :py:class:`~oggm.GlacierDirectory`) are folders
on disk which store the input and output data **for a single glacier** during
an OGGM run. The data are on disk to be persistent, i.e. they won't be deleted
unless you ask OGGM to. You can start a run from an existing directory,
avoiding to re-do unnecessary computations.

Initialising a glacier directory
--------------------------------

The easiest way to initialize a glacier directory is to start from a
pre-processed state available on the OGGM servers:


.. ipython:: python

    import os
    import oggm
    from oggm import cfg, workflow
    from oggm.utils import gettempdir
    cfg.initialize()  # always initialize before an OGGM task
    # The working directory is where OGGM will store the run's data
    cfg.PATHS['working_dir'] = os.path.join(gettempdir(), 'Docs_GlacierDir')
    gdirs = workflow.init_glacier_directories('RGI60-11.00897',
                                              from_prepro_level=1,
                                              prepro_border=10)
    gdir = gdirs[0]  # init_glacier_directories always returns a list


We just downloaded the minimal input for a glacier directory. The
``GlacierDirectory`` object contains the glacier metadata:

.. ipython:: python

    gdir
    gdir.rgi_id

It also points to a specific directory in disk, where the files are written
to:

.. ipython:: python

    gdir.dir
    os.listdir(gdir.dir)

Users usually don't have to care about *where* the data is located.
``GlacierDirectory`` objects help you to get this information:


.. ipython:: python

    fdem = gdir.get_filepath('dem')
    fdem
    import rioxarray as rioxr
    @savefig plot_gdir_dem.png width=80%
    rioxr.open_rasterio(fdem).plot(cmap='terrain');

This persistence on disk allows for example to continue a workflow that has
been previously interrupted. Initialising a GlacierDirectory from a non-empty
folder won't erase its content:

.. ipython:: python

    gdir = workflow.init_glacier_directories('RGI60-11.00897')[0]
    os.listdir(gdir.dir)  # the directory still contains the data

`tutorial on the topic <https://oggm.org/tutorials/master/notebooks/store_and_compress_glacierdirs.html>`_.

Mass balance
============

Mass balance models found in the ``core.massbalance`` module.

.. currentmodule:: oggm.core.massbalance

They follow the :py:class:`MassBalanceModel` interface. Here is a quick summary
of the units and conventions used by all models:

Units
-----

The computed mass balance is in units of [m ice s-1] ("meters of ice per
second"), unless otherwise specified (e.g. for the utility function
``get_specific_mb``).
The conversion from the climatic mass balance ([kg m-2 s-1] ) therefore assumes
an ice density given by ``cfg.PARAMS['ice_density']`` (currently: 900 kg m-3).

Time
----

.. currentmodule:: oggm

The time system used by OGGM is a simple "fraction of year" system, where
the floating year can be used for conversion to months and years:

.. ipython:: python

    from oggm.utils import floatyear_to_date, date_to_floatyear
    date_to_floatyear(1982, 12)
    floatyear_to_date(1.2)

Model Flowlines
===============

Flowlines are what represent a glacier in OGGM.
During the preprocessing stage of a glacier simulation these lines evolve from
simple topography following lines to more abstract objects within the model.

This chapter provides an overview on the different line types, how to access
the model flowlines and their attributes.

Hierarchy
---------

First a short summary of the evolution or the hierarchy of these different
flowline stages:

.. currentmodule:: oggm.core.centerlines

geometrical centerlines
   These lines are calculated following the algorithm of
   `Kienholz et al., (2014)`_. They determine where the subsequent flowlines
   are situated and how many of them are needed for one glacier. The main task
   for this calculation is :py:func:`compute_centerlines`. These lines are not
   stored within a specific OGGM class but are stored within the
   GlacierDirectory as shapely objects.

inversion flowlines
   To use the geometrical lines within the model they are transformed to
   :py:class:`~oggm.Centerline` objects. This is done within
   :py:func:`~oggm.core.centerlines.initialize_flowlines` where the lines are projected onto a xy-grid
   with regular spaced line-points. This step also takes care of tributary
   junctions. These lines are then in a later step also used for the bed
   inversion, hence their name.

downstream line
    This line extends the glacier's centerline along the unglaciated glacier
    bed which is necessary for advancing glaciers. This line is calculated
    along the valley floor to the end of the domain boundary within
    :py:func:`compute_downstream_line`.

.. currentmodule:: oggm.core.flowline

model flowlines
   The dynamical OGGM model finally uses lines of the class
   :py:class:`Flowline` for all simulations. These flowlines are created by
   :py:func:`init_present_time_glacier`, which combines information from
   several preprocessing steps, the downstream line and the bed inversion.
   From a user perspective, especially if preprocessed directories are used,
   these model flowlines are the most important ones and further information
   on the class interface and attributes are given below.

.. _Kienholz et al., (2014): http://www.the-cryosphere.net/8/503/2014/

Access
------

The easiest and most common way to access the model flowlines of a glacier is
with its GlacierDirectory. For this we initialize a minimal working example
including the model flowlines. This is achieved by choosing preprocessing level
4.

.. ipython:: python

    import os
    import oggm
    from oggm import cfg, workflow
    from oggm.utils import gettempdir
    cfg.initialize()  # always initialize before an OGGM task
    # The working directory is where OGGM will store the run's data
    cfg.PATHS['working_dir'] = os.path.join(gettempdir(), 'Docs_GlacierDir2')
    gdirs = workflow.init_glacier_directories('RGI60-11.00897',
                                              from_prepro_level=5,
                                              prepro_border=80)
    gdir = gdirs[0]  # init_glacier_directories always returns a list

    fls = gdir.read_pickle('model_flowlines')
    fls
    [fl.order for fl in fls]

This glacier has three flowlines of type `MixedBedFlowline` provided as a list.
And the flowlines are ordered by ascending Strahler numbers, where the last entry
in the list is always the longest and very often most relevant flowline of
that glacier.
