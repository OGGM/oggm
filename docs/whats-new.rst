v1.1.2 (12.09.2019)
-------------------

Minor release of the OGGM model, with several substancial improvements, most
notably:

- update in the inversion procedure for calving glaciers (Recinos et al., 2019)
- new glacier evolution model based on Marzeion et al., 2012

We don't expect major changes in the model results due to this release.


Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``run_until`` now makes sure that the years (months) are not crossed by
  the adaptive time-stepping scheme (:issue:`710`). ``run_until`` and
  ``run_until_and_store`` should now be consistent. The change is unlikely to
  affect the majority of users (which used ``run_until_and_store``), but
  the results or ``run_until`` can be affected (:pull:`726`).
  By `Matthias Dusch <https://github.com/matthiasdusch>`_.
- ``find_inversion_calving`` has been renamed to
  ``find_inversion_calving_loop`` and will probably be deprecated soon
  (:pull:`794`).
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- ``use_rgi_area=False`` now also recomputes CenLon and CenLat on the fly.
  (:issue:`838`).
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added new ``gridded_attributes`` and ``gridded_mb_attributes`` tasks to
  add raster glacier attributes such as slope, aspect, mass-balance...
  to the glacier directory (:pull:`725`). This can be useful for statistical
  modelling of glacier thickness.
  By `Matteo Castellani <https://github.com/MatCast>`_.
- Added support for a new DEM dataset: Mapzen, found on Amazon cloud
  (:issue:`748`, :pull:`759`). Also added some utility functions to handle
  DEMs, to be improved further in the near future.
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- Added support for a new DEM dataset: REMA (:pull:`759`).
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- Added an option to pre-process all DEMs at once (:pull:`771`).
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- Added support for another evolution model: the volume-area-scaling based
  model of Marzeion et al., 2012 (:pull:`662`). This is a major enhancement
  to the code base as it increases the number of choices available to users
  and demonstrates the modularity of the model.
  By `Moritz Oberrauch <https://github.com/oberrauch>`_.
- Changed the way the calving flux is computed during the ice thickness
  inversion. This no longer relies on an iteration over mu*, but solves
  for `h` instead. The new function is likely to replace the "old"
  calving loop (:pull:`794`).
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- ``compile_climate_input`` and ``compile_run_output`` are now faster for
  larger numbers of glaciers thanks to temporary files (:pull:`814`).
  By `Anouk Vlug <https://github.com/anoukvlug>`_. Could be made faster with
  multiprocessing one day.
- OGGM can now run in "minimal mode", i.e. without many of the hard
  dependencies (:issue:`420`). This is useful for teaching or idealized
  simulations, but won't work in production.
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- the flowline model gives access to new diagnostics such as ice velocity and
  flux along the flowline. The numerical core code changed in the process,
  and we will monitor performance after this change (:pull:`853`).
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Preprocessed directories at the level 3 now also have the glacier flowlines
  ready for the run (:issue:`736`, :pull:`771`).
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- Nominal glaciers now error early in the processing chain (:issue:`832`).
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- Specific MB (not used operationaly) was wrongly computer for zero ice
  thickness rectangular or parabolic sections. This is now corrected
  (:issue:`828`).
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- Fixed a bug in model output files where SH glaciers were wrongly attributed
  with NH calendar dates (:issue:`824`).
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.


v1.1.1 (24.04.2019)
-------------------

Minor release of the OGGM model, with several bugfixes and some improvements.

We don't expect any change in the model results due to this release.

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Adapted ``graphics.plot_domain``, ``graphics.plot_centerlines`` and
  ``graphics_plot_modeloutput_map`` to work with merged glaciers (:pull:`726`).
  By `Matthias Dusch <https://github.com/matthiasdusch>`_.
- Added (and updated) an official task to find the calving flux based on the
  mass-conservation inversion (`inversion.find_inversion_calving`). This
  is still in experimentation phase! (:pull:`720`).
  By `Beatriz Recinos <https://github.com/bearecinos>`_.
- Added a mechanism to add custom MB data to OGGM (:issue:`724`).
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- The ALOS Global Digital Surface Model "ALOS World 3D - 30m" DEM from JAXA can
  now be used as alternative DEM within OGGM.
  `See our tutorial <http://edu.oggm.org/en/latest/oggm_tuto.html>`_ on how to
  set an alternative DEM (:pull:`734`).
  By `Matthias Dusch <https://github.com/matthiasdusch>`_.
- Switch to setuptools-scm as a version control system (:issue:`727`).
  By `Timo Rothenpieler <https://github.com/TimoRoth>`_.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed several problems with the file download verification algorithm.
  By `Timo Rothenpieler <https://github.com/TimoRoth>`_.
- Fixed a timing problem in the benchmark command line tool (:pull:`717`).
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.


v1.1 (28.02.2019)
-----------------

This is a major new release of the OGGM model, with substantial improvements
to version 1. We recommend to use this version from now on. It coincides
with the publication of our publication in
`Geoscientific Model Development <https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/12/909/2019/>`_.

New contributors to the project:

- **Matthias Dusch** (PhD student, University of Innsbruck), added extensive
  cross-validation tools and an associated website.
- **Philipp Gregor** (Master student, University of Innsbruck), added options
  to switch on lateral bed stress in the flowline ice dynamics
- **Nicolas Champollion** (PostDoc, University of Bremen), added GCM data
  IO routines.
- **Sadie Bartholomew** (Software Engineer, UK Met Office), added ability to
  replace colormaps in graphics with HCL-based colors using python-colorspace.

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The utils.copy_to_basedir() function is changed to being an entity task. In
  addition gcm_data files, when present, will from now on always be copied
  when using this task (:issue:`467` & :pull:`468`).
  By `Anouk Vlug <https://github.com/anoukvlug>`_.
- Accumulation Area Ratio (AAR) is now correctly computed (:issue:`361`).
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- The method used to apply CRU and GCM anomalies to the climatology has
  changed for precipitation: we now use scaled anomalies instead of the
  standard anomalies (:pull:`393`). The previous method might have lead to
  negative values in some cases. The corresponding reference t* have also
  been updated (:pull:`407`). This change has some consequences on the
  the model results: cross-validation indicates very similar scores, but
  the influence on global model output has not been assessed yet.
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- It is now possible to run a simulation with spinup in the standard
  workflow (:pull:`411`). For this to happen it was necessary to clean up
  the many `*filesuffix` options. The new names are more explicit
  but not backwards compatible. The previous `filesuffix` is now
  called `output_filesuffix`. The previous `input_filesuffix` is now
  called `climate_input_filesuffix`. The `random_glacier_evolution` task
  is now called `run_random_climate` for consistency with the other tasks
  See the PR linked above for more info.
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- RGI version 4 isn't supported anymore (:issue:`142`).
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- Rework of the 2d interpolation tasks for ice thickness in the context of
  `ITMIX2 <http://oggm.org/2018/05/21/g2ti/>`_. The new interpolation
  are better, but not backwards compatible. Aside of me I don't think
  anybody was using them (:pull:`465`).
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- Diagnostic variables (length, area, volume, ELA) are now stored at annual
  steps instead of montly steps (:pull:`488`). The old behavior can still be
  used with the ``store_monthly_step`` kwarg. Most users should not notice
  this change because the regionally compiled files were stored at yearly
  steps anyways.
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- The list of reference t* dates is now generated differently: instead of
  the complex (and sort of useless) nearest neighbor algorithm we are now
  referring back to the original method of Marzeion et al. (2012). This comes
  together with other breaking changes, altogether likely to change the
  results of the mass-balance model for some glaciers. For more details see
  the PR: :pull:`509`
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- The ice dynamics parameters (Glen A, N, ice density) are now "real"
  parameters accessible via ``cfg.PARAMS`` (:pull:`520`, :issue:`511` and
  :issue:`27`). Previously, they were also accessible via a module attribute
  in ``cfg``, which was more confusing than helping. Deprecated and removed
  a couple of other things on the go, such as the dangerous `
  ``optimize_inversion_params`` task (this cannot be optimized yet) and the
  useless ``volume_inversion`` wrapper (now called
  ``mass_conservation_inversion``)
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- The temperature sensitivity mu* is now flowline specific, instead of
  glacier wide. This change was necessary because it now allows low-lying
  tributaries to exist, despite of too high glacier wide mu*. This change
  had some wider reaching consequences in the code base and in the
  mass-balance models in particular: :pull:`539`. This will also allow to
  merge neighboring glaciers in the future.
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- The "human readable" mu* information is now stored in a JSON dict instead
  of a csv: :pull:`568`.
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- The global task `glacier_characteristics` has been renamed to
  `compile_glacier_statistics` (:pull:`571`).
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- The ``process_cesm_data`` task has been been moved to `gcm_climate.py`
  adressing: :issue:`469` & :pull:`582`.
  By `Anouk Vlug <https://github.com/anoukvlug>`_.
- The shapefiles are now stored in the glacier directories as compressed
  tar files, adressing :issue:`367` & :issue:`615`. This option can be
  turned off with `cfg.PARAMS['use_tar_shapefiles'] = False`.
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added a utility function to easily get intersects files (:pull:`402`).
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- The old GlaThiDa file linking the total volume of glaciers (T database) to
  RGI has been updated to RGI Version 6 (:pull:`403`).
  Generally, we do not recommend to use these data for calibration or
  validation because of largely unknown uncertainties.
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- The computing efficiency of the 2D shallow ice model has been increased
  by a factor 2 (:pull:`415`), by avoiding useless repetitions of indexing
  operations. The results shouldn't change at all.
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- Added optional shape factors for mass-conservation inversion and
  FluxBasedModel to account for lateral drag dependent on the bed shape
  (:pull:`429`). Accepted settings for shape factors are `None`,
  `'Adhikari'` (Adhikari & Marshall 2012), `'Nye'` (Nye, 1965; equivalent to
  Adhikari) and `'Huss'` (Huss & Farinotti 2012). Thorough tests with
  applied shape factors are still missing.
  By `Philipp Gregor <https://github.com/phigre>`_.
- Some amelioration to the mass-balance models (:pull:`434`). Added a
  ``repeat`` kwarg to the ``PastMassBalance`` in order to loop over a
  selected period. Added an ``UncertainMassBalance`` model which wraps
  an existing model and adds random uncertainty to it.
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- The DEM sources are now clearly stated in each glacier directory,
  along with the original data citation (:pull:`441`). We encourage
  to always cite the original data providers.
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- Added some diagnostic tools which make it easier to detect dubious glacier
  outlines or DEM errors (:pull:`445`). This will be used to report to the
  RGI authors.
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- Added a new parameter (``PARAMS['use_rgi_area']``), which specifies whether
  OGGM should use the reference area provided by RGI or the one computed
  from the local map and reprojected outlines  (:pull:`458`, default: True).
  By `Matthias Dusch <https://github.com/matthiasdusch>`_.
- A new ``simple_glacier_masks`` tasks allows to compute glacier rasters in
  a more robust way than the default OGGM method (:pull:`476`). This is useful
  for simpler workflows or to compute global statistics for external tools
  like `rgitools <http://rgitools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. This task
  also computes hypsometry files much like RGI does.
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- Reference glaciers now have mass-balance profiles attached to them, if
  available. You can get the profiles with ``gdir.get_ref_mb_profile()``
  (:pull:`493`).
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- New ``process_histalp_data`` taks to run OGGM with HISTALP data
  automatically. The task comes with a list of predefined t* like CRU and
  with different default parameters
  (see `blog <https://oggm.org/2018/08/10/histalp-parameters/>`_). The PR
  also adds some safety checks at the calibration and computation of the
  mass-balance to make sure there is no misused parameters (:pull:`493`).
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- The ``process_cesm_data`` function has been split into two functions, to make
  it easier to run oggm with the climate of other GCM's: ``process_cesm_data``
  reads the CESM files and handles the CESM specific file logic.
  ``process_gcm_data`` is the general task able to handle all kind of data.
  ``process_cesm_data`` can also be used as an example when you plan make a
  function for running OGGM with another GCM (:issue:`469` & :pull:`582`).
  `Anouk Vlug <https://github.com/anoukvlug>`_.
- New ``process_dummy_cru_file`` task to run OGGM with randomized CRU data
  (:pull:`603`).
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- Colormaps in some graphics are replaced with Hue-Chroma-Luminance (HCL) based
  improvements when python-colorspace is (optionally) installed (:pull:`587`).
  By `Sadie Bartholomew <https://github.com/sadielbartholomew>`_.
- Added a workflow ``merge_glacier_tasks`` which merges tributary/surrounding
  glaciers to a main glacier, allowing mass exchange between them. This is
  helpfull/neccessary/intended for growing glacier experiments (e.g.
  paleoglaciology) (:pull:`624`).
  By `Matthias Dusch <https://github.com/matthiasdusch>`_.
- New ``oggm_prepro`` command line tool to run the OGGM preprocessing tasks
  and compress the directories (:pull:`648`).
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- `init_glacier_regions` task now accepts RGI Ids strongs as input instead of
  only Geodataframes previously (:pull:`656`).
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- The ``entity_task`` decorator now accepts a fallback-function which will be
  executed if a task fails and `cfg.PARAMS['continue_on_error'] = True`. So far
  only one fallback function is implemented for `climate.local_t_star`
  (:pull:`663`).
  By `Matthias Dusch <https://github.com/matthiasdusch>`_.
- New `process_gcm_data` task to handle CMIP5 files.
  By `Nicolas Champollion <https://github.com/nchampollion>`_.


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

  in some rare cases the percentile threshold was too low (:pull:`444`).
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- Fixed a caching bug in the test suite, where some tests used to fail when run
  for a second time on a modified gdir (:pull:`448`).
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- Fixed a problem with netCDF4 versions > 1.3 which returns masked arrays
  per default. We now prevent netCDF4 to return masked arrays altogether
  (:issue:`482`).
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.

  (:pull:`408`). By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- Test fix for googlemaps.
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- Added a utility function (:py:func:`~utils.idealized_gdir`) useful
  to dow flowline experiments without have to create a local map (:pull:`413`).
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
