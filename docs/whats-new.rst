Version history
===============

v1.X (unreleased)
-----------------

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The utils.copy_to_basedir() function is changed to being an entity task. In
  addition cesm_data files, when present, will from now on always be copied
  when using this task (:issue:`467` & :pull:`468`).
  By `Anouk Vlug <https://github.com/anoukvlug>`_.
- Accumulation Area Ratio (AAR) is now correctly computed (:issue:`361`).
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- The method used to apply CRU and GCM anomalies to the climatology has
  changed for precipitation: we now use scaled anomalies instead of the
  standard anomalies (:pull:`393`). The previous method might have lead to
  negative values in some cases. The corresponding reference t* have also
  been updated (:pull:`407`). This change has some consequences on the
  the model results: cross-validation indicates very similar scores, but
  the influence on global model output has not been assessed yet.
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- It is now possible to run a simulation with spinup in the standard
  workflow (:pull:`411`). For this to happen it was necessary to clean up
  the many `*filesuffix` options. The new names are more explicit
  but not backwards compatible. The previous `filesuffix` is now
  called `output_filesuffix`. The previous `input_filesuffix` is now
  called `climate_input_filesuffix`. The `random_glacier_evolution` task
  is now called `run_random_climate` for consistency with the other tasks
  See the PR linked above for more info.
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- RGI version 4 isn't supported anymore (:issue:`142`).
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- Rework of the 2d interpolation tasks for ice thickness in the context of
  `ITMIX2 <http://oggm.org/2018/05/21/g2ti/>`_. The new interpolation
  are better, but not backwards compatible. Aside of me I don't think
  anybody was using them (:pull:`465`).
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- Diagnostic variables (length, area, volume, ELA) are now stored at annual
  steps instead of montly steps (:pull:`488`). The old behavior can still be
  used with the ``store_monthly_step`` kwarg. Most users should not notice
  this change because the regionally compiled files were stored at yearly
  steps anyways.
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- The list of reference t* dates is now generated differently: instead of
  the complex (and sort of useless) neirest beighbor algorithm we are now
  referring back to the original method of Marzeion et al. (2012). This comes
  together with other breaking changes, altogether likely to change the
  results of the mass-balance model for some glaciers. For more details see
  the PR: :pull:`509`
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added a utility function to easily get intersects files (:pull:`402`).
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- The old GlaThiDa file linking the total volume of glaciers (T database) to
  RGI has been updated to RGI Version 6 (:pull:`403`).
  Generally, we do not recommend to use these data for calibration or
  validation because of largely unknown uncertainties.
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- The computing efficiency of the 2D shallow ice model has been increased
  by a factor 2 (:pull:`415`), by avoiding useless repetitions of indexing
  operations. The results shouldn't change at all.
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- Added optional shape factors for mass-conservation inversion and
  FluxBasedModel to account for lateral drag dependent on the bed shape
  (:pull:`429`). Accepted settings for shape factors are `None`,
  `'Adhikari'` (Adhikari & Marshall 2012), `'Nye'` (Nye, 1965; equivalent to
  Adhikari) and `'Huss'` (Huss & Farinotti 2012). Thorough tests with
  applied shape factors are still missing.
  By `Philipp Gregor <https://github.com/phigre>`_.
- Some amelioration to the mass-balance models (:pull:`434`). Added a
  ``repeat`` kwarg to the ``PastMassBalance`` in order to loop over a
  selected period. Added an ``UncertainMassBalance`` model which wraps
  an existing model and adds random uncertainty to it.
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- The DEM sources are now clearly stated in each glacier directory,
  along with the original data citation (:pull:`441`). We encourage
  to always cite the original data providers.
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- Added some diagnostic tools which make it easier to detect dubious glacier
  outlines or DEM errors (:pull:`445`). This will be used to report to the
  RGI authors.
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- Added a new parameter (``PARAMS['use_rgi_area']``), which specifies whether
  OGGM should use the reference area provided by RGI or the one computed
  from the local map and reprojected outlines  (:pull:`458`, default: True).
  By `Matthias Dusch <https://github.com/matthiasdusch>`_.
- A new ``simple_glacier_masks`` tasks allows to compute glacier rasters in
  a more robust way than the default OGGM method (:pull:`476`). This is useful
  for simpler workflows or to compute global statistics for external tools
  like `rgitools <http://rgitools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. This task
  also computes hypsometry files much like RGI does.
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- Reference glaciers now have mass-balance profiles attached to them, if
  available. You can get the profiles with ``gdir.get_ref_mb_profile()``
  (:pull:`493`).
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Remove dependency to deprecated matplotlib._cntr module (:issue:`418`).
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- Fixed a bug in tidewater glaciers terminus position finding, where
  in some rare cases the percentile threshold was too low (:pull:`444`).
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- Fixed a caching bug in the test suite, where some tests used to fail when run
  for a second time on a modified gdir (:pull:`448`).
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- Fixed a problem with netCDF4 versions > 1.3 which returns masked arrays
  per default. We now prevent netCDF4 to return masked arrays altogether
  (:issue:`482`).
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.


Internals
~~~~~~~~~

- We now use a dedicated server for input data such as modified RGI files
  (:pull:`408`). By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- Test fix for googlemaps.
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.
- Added a utility function (:py:func:`~utils.idealized_gdir`) useful
  to dow flowline experiments without have to create a local map (:pull:`413`).
  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.


.. _whats-new.1.0:

v1.0 (16 January 2018)
----------------------

This is the first official major release of OGGM. It is concomitant to the
submission of a manuscript to
`Geoscientific Model Development (GMD) <https://www.geoscientific-model-development.net>`_.

This marks the stabilization of the codebase (hopefully) and implies that
future changes will have to be documented carefully to ensure traceability.

New contributors to the project:

- **Anouk Vlug** (PhD student, University of Bremen), added the CESM
  climate data tools.
- **Anton Butenko** (PhD student, University of Bremen), developed the
  downstream bedshape algorithm
- **Beatriz Recinos** (PhD student, University of Bremen), participated to the
  development of the calving parametrization
- **Julia Eis** (PhD student, University of Bremen), developed the glacier
  partitioning algorithm
- **Schmitty Smith** (PhD student,  Northand College, Wisconsin US), added
  optional parameters to the mass-balance models

Minor release: changes in ITMIX to handle the synthetic glacier cases.

It was tagged only recently for long term documentation purposes and storage
on `Zenodo <https://zenodo.org/record/292630#.WMAwelcX77g>`_.
