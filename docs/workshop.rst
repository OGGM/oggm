2nd OGGM Workshop
=================
After the successful 1st OGGM workshop in Obergurgl, Austria, in February 2016, we will hold the 2nd workshop on the East Frisian Island Spiekeroog.

Save the date
-------------

March 29 2017 (arrival) to April 02 2017 (departure)

Topics
------

We will discuss all issues regarding the current state of OGGM, including:

- handling of Antarctic peripheral glaciers
- improvements to the surface mass balance module
- dynamical core and adjoint modeling
- initialization strategies
- handling debris cover
- calving/ocean-ice interaction
- running OGGM on long time scales (reconstruction and commitment experiments)
- converting the numerical core to C or Fortran
- funding strategies
- general scientific goals and rationale

Transfer etc.
-------------

We will organize the transfer from Bremen (airport and/or central station) to the island and back - specifics (particularly about the timing, which depends on the tides) will be announced later. 

Accommodation
-------------

The workshop will take place in two adjacent, self catered apartments. This will keep costs down, while unfortunately limiting the number of participants.

Fee
---

There is no fee, but participants will have to cover their own travel costs and their share of the costs for accommodation and meals.

Registration
------------

Please get in touch with Ben (ben.marzeion@uni-bremen.de) or Fabien (fabien.maussion@uibk.ac.at) for more information and registration.
