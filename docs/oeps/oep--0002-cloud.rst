Abstract
--------

We plan to provide the service of "running the OGGM model" via an online
platform (a "hub") where users can log-in and benefit from a containerized
and persistent environment where OGGM can run and its output can be analyzed.
This environment must scale with the number of users and the resources they
requested, and allow "serious work" as well as exploratory experimenting and
teaching.
