RGI-TOPO (RGI 6.0 and RGI 7.0)
==============================

The RGI-TOPO dataset provides a local topography map for each single glacier in the RGI.
It was generated with OGGM, and can be used very easily from the :doc:`shop` (visit
our `tutorials <https://oggm.org/tutorials>`_ if you want to learn how to use them!).
