ITMIX Experiment 2016
=====================

OGGM participates to the `ITMIX`_ experiment organised by the IACS
`Working Group`_ on Glacier Ice Thickness Estimation.

.. _ITMIX: http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~danielfa/IACS/register.html
.. _Working Group: http://www.cryosphericsciences.org/wg_glacierIceThickEst.html

The idea is to compare several models able to provide a distributed estimate of
glacier ice thickness. The participants can submit their estimations for one
(or more) of 18 selected glaciers. The experiment is supposed to be "blind",
i.e. the perticipants are not aware of the actual ice thickness of the
glaciers they are modelling.

The deadline for the experiment was February 29th. Definitely too early
for OGGM, with which we had performed the inversion for the European Alps
only. We still didn't want to miss this opportunity and started an
intense `development phase`_ to make OGGM applicable globally. After quite a
lot of `work`_ we are now able to provide an estimate for all
glaciers except Starbuck in Antarctica. While this surely marks an important
step in the development of OGGM, this project again raised many questions and
digged a few issues out, since (as you will see below), nothing is easy when
doing global scale distributed modelling.

ITMIX preprocessing
-------------------

The glaciers are heterogeneous: valley glaciers, ice-caps,
marine-terminating...

*Blue: ITMIX outlines, Black: RGI outlines. White means that ITMIX didn't
provide the topography.*

The first step that we needed to do is to formalize all this data so that
OGGM can deal with it. This turned out to be a bit complicated since the
ITMIX data was not standardized:

- we updated the RGI outlines with the ITMIX ones where possible
- for ice-caps, we kept the RGI outlines because OGGM currently needs the
  "pieces of cake" to compute the centerlines - see the important implications
  below.
- we decided to to compute the inversion on the OGGM local grids, not on the
  IMIX maps. This is important because OGGM makes decisions about the grid
  spacing it uses. Furthermore, the entire workflow is depending on these
  standardized local maps. We introduced a new routine in the pipeline in order
  to update the SRTM/ASTER topography with the ITMIX one. This also was not
  trivial because some ITMIX topographies are stopping directly at the
  glacier boundary.


OGGM preprocessing
------------------

Topography
~~~~~~~~~~

OGGM uses following DEM data:

- SRTM V4.1 for [60S, 60N] (http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/)
- GIMP DEM for Greenland (https://bpcrc.osu.edu/gdg/data/gimpdem)
- Corrected DEMs for Svalbard, Iceland, and North Canada
  (http://viewfinderpanoramas.org/dem3.html)
- ASTER V2 elsewhere

The corrected DEMs where necessary because ASTER data has many issues over
glaciers. Take for example the DEM for two glaciers in Iceland:

.. thumbnail:: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/20930277/itmix_public/wgms_dyngjujoekull_rgi50-06.00477_dom.png?raw=1
    :width: 49%
.. thumbnail:: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/20930277/itmix_public/rgi50-07.01394.png?raw=1
    :width: 49%

Note that the hypsometry provided in RGI V5 also contains these errors.
While the problems with the right plot are obvious, the glacier on the left
(*Dyngjujoekull*) is practically impossible to filter automatically. On the
plot below, I show the hypsometry that OGGM computed and the one by Mathias
Huss:

.. thumbnail:: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/20930277/itmix_public/hypso_rgi50-06.00477.png?raw=1
    :width: 60%

Up to a few discrepancies due to projection issues, we both have the problem
of non-zero bins below 750 m a.s.l. Fortunately, thanks to the work by
`Jonathan de Ferranti`_, these problems are now resolved in OGGM:

.. _Jonathan de Ferranti: http://viewfinderpanoramas.org/dem3.html

    :width: 60%

There is potential for even better coverage of corrected DEM, but this would
require a bit more work (J. de Ferranti's data is not always logically
structured).


Calibration data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another obstacle to global coverage was that the databases required for
calibration (WGMS FoG and GlaThiDa) are not "linked" to RGI, i.e. there is
no way to know which RGI entity corresponds to each database entry. Thanks
to the work of `Johannes Landmann`_ at UIBK we now have comprehensive links
with global coverage.

.. _`Johannes Landmann`: https://github.com/OGGM/databases-links

Some of the ITMIX glaciers were in the database, I removed them manually for
the sake of the experiment ("blind run"):

- WGMS: Kesselwandferner, Brewster, Devon, Elbrus, Freya, Hellstugubreen,
  Urumqi
- GlaThiDa: Kesselwandferner, Unteraar

These leaves us with 201861 WGMS glaciers with at least 5 years of mass-balance
data available for calibration of the mass-balance:

.. figure:: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/20930277/itmix_public/globmap_wgms.png?raw=1
    :width: 100%

And 133 GlaThiDa glaciers with glacier-wide average thickness estimates. The
coverage of GlaThiDa is not very good, which is probably a problem:

.. figure:: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/20930277/itmix_public/globmap_glathida.png?raw=1
    :width: 100%


Inversion procedure
-------------------

Refer to the general `documentation`_ for details about the inversion
procedure.

.. _documentation: http://oggm.org

Here we go directly to the calibration results of the ice-thickness
inversion. OGGM currently has only one free parameter to tune for the ice
thickness inversion: Glen's creep parameter *A*. This is very similar to
[Farinotti_etal_2009]_, with the difference that we are not calibrating *A*
for each glacier individually: we tried to do that, but didn't manage (yet).

Land-terminating glaciers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently, *A* is varied until the glacier-wide thickness computed by OGGM
minimizes the RMSD with GlaThiDa. We removed all ice-caps and
marine-terminating glaciers from the dataset in
order to avoid these specific cases (135 glaciers left). Here are the
results of the calibration (left: volume-area scaling, right: OGGM):

.. figure:: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/20930277/itmix_public/scatter_all_glaciers.png?raw=1
    :width: 100%

We can see that OGGM has a slightly lower score than volume-area scaling
(VAS). This is due to the presence of a couple of outliers. In particular,
the thickest glacier in GlaThiDa and VAS is strinkingly thin in OGGM: this
is the  Black Rapids glacier in Canada, which is quite well mentioned in the
literature because it is a surging glacier. Closer inspection in OGGM
reveals that this glacier has one of the lowest mass-balance gradient. CRU
precipitation is 849 mm yr :math:`^{1}` (after application of the 2.5
correction factor!), which I assume is too low.

We recall here that one central difference between our approach and that of
[HussFarinotti_2012]_ is that we use real climate data to compute the
apparent mass-balance, and thus have glacier specific mass-balance gradients.
This is a strength but can also become a burden. The mass-balance gradient
depends mostly on precipitation, but also on temperature and its seasonal
cycle. Here I show the apparent mass-balance gradient in the ablation area
of all GlaThiDa glaciers:

.. figure:: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/20930277/itmix_public/mb_grad.png?raw=1
    :width: 100%

Is the MB gradient related to the error OGGM makes in comparison to GlaThiDa?

.. figure:: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/20930277/itmix_public/rel_error.png?raw=1
    :width: 100%

No not really. And this is similar with all other glacier characteristics I
could look at until now. The error that OGGM makes is not easily
attributable to specific causes... It it would, that would be great! Indeed,
this would allow maybe to define a rule for the calibration factor *A*. If
you have ideas at which parameter to look at, let me know!

VAS vs OGGM
~~~~~~~~~~~

I don't want the calibration to be too altered by the Black Rapids outlier,
so I removed it from the calibration set. The plot now looks better, and
after this little hack OGGM is even *slightly* better than VAS:

.. figure:: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/20930277/itmix_public/scatter_all_glaciers_no_rapids.png?raw=1
    :width: 100%

What is really interesting however is that OGGM and VAS are incredibly
similar in their dissimilarity with GlaThiDa. So similar that if we plot the
two approaches together on a scatter, one could argue that the thousands of
lines of code of OGGM really aren't worth the effort ;). I think that I have
to talk to David Bahr about this, he will surely be pleased.

.. figure:: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/20930277/itmix_public/vas_vs_oggm.png?raw=1
    :width: 50%


A problem with large glaciers?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These results for the reference glaciers availble in GlaThiDa were somehow
OK, but the issue with the Black Rapids glacier made me wonder a
little bit and I decided to have a closer look. In the figure below I compare
the OGGM inversion results with VAS for all glaciers I have at hand for the
experiment (ITMIX + WGMS + GlaThiDa, land-terminating, no ice-caps).

.. figure:: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/20930277/itmix_public/vas_vs_oggm_large.png?raw=1
    :width: 50%

After many hours (days?) of searching for a reasonable explanation for this
behavior, I had to renounce. I will have to make a test under controlled
conditions to see if this is actually a bug in OGGM or if it is something
inherent to the methodology.


The problem with ice-caps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This one is easier: ice caps are cut into smaller pieces of cake, instead of
being considered as a large glacier. Like VAS, OGGM will also fail since
the volume of glaciers is expected to grow with a power law to its area. The
flowline methodology followed by OGGM on ice caps is very likely to
underestimate the total ice volume.


Marine-terminating glaciers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the apparent mass-balance method for calving glaciers will lead to
overestimated thicknesses. In the future, OGGM will intend to parametrize
mass-flux at calving fronts. For ITMIX, we will consider mass loss by
calving for Columbia glacier only. From [Rasmussen_etal_2011]_, we assume
two possible calving rates for Columbia: 4.3 and 8.0 km :math:`^{3}` ice eq.
a :math:`^{-1}`, to which we arbitrarily add a third case with 12
km :math:`^{3}` ice eq. a :math:`^{-1}`. This mass loss at the calving front
is distributed over the glacier and added to the apparent mass-balance,
resulting in total ice volumes of 250, 273, and 291 km :math:`^{3}`,
respectively.


Putting all this together
-------------------------

We find an optimised factor for *A* of 3.22 (i.e. our *A* is three
times larger than the standard of 2.4e-24 [Cuffey_Paterson_2010]_). This
makes sense since we do not consider the sliding velocity in the inversion,
which means that we need an ice which is less stiff to compensate.

The inversion procedure in OGGM is not designed to provide a distributed
estimate of glacier thickness: in particular, the glacier widths in OGGM are
not always geometrical as in Farinotti et al. (2009): they are also
corrected so that the altitude-area distribution of the glacier is preserved.

We show a few examples of the normal inversion procedure in OGGM, which is
meant to provide the intput to a flowline model:

    :width: 49%


Distributed ice thickness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a final step, we had to somehow interpolate the flowline thicknesses to
the ITMIX map. Here again we made the choice to keep as much logic as
possible within the standard OGGM framework and defined a new task,
:py:func:`oggm.tasks.distribute_thickness`. We compute the ice
thickness on the OGGM local map and simply interpolate our results on the high
resolution ITMIX grid only at the very end.

The distribution works as follows:

- for each pixel, the closest flowlines thicknesses within a 100m altitude
  range are interpolated using an inverse distance weight
- this value is then corrected with a factor depending on the distance to
  the glacier outlines
- finally, the thickness is corrected with a factor
  :math:`1 / \alpha^{\frac{N}{N+2}}` as in Farinotti et al. (2009). Since I
  had no time to check if this correction works better, I submitted two
  versions of the interpolation (with or without local slope correction).

An example of the interpolation for Columbia glacier with (left) or without
(right) slope correction:

    :width: 49%

For the ice caps, the interpolation methods lead to similar results.
However, it is very likely that the flowline methodology used by OGGM is not
working properly.

Conclusions
-----------

We were able to provide an estimate of ice thickness for all glaciers except
Starbuck in Antarctica. I am less confident about the distributed maps than
the total volume estimates. I am also much less confident about the
ice-caps (they are probably totally crap) and also less confident about the
larger glaciers than the smaller ones.
