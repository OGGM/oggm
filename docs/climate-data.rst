Climate data
============

Here are the various climate datasets that OGGM can handle automatically, using the for instance
one of the following functions to pre-process the climate data:

.. code-block:: python

    from oggm.tasks import process_w5e5_data
    from oggm.tasks import import process_cru_data
    from oggm.tasks import import process_histalp_data
    from oggm.tasks import import process_ecmwf_data

.. warning::

.. _climate-w5e5:

W5E5
~~~~

As of v1.6, W5E5 is the standard dataset used by OGGM as reference. All
preprocessed directories use it.

TODO: explain what W5E5 is and why it is the default.

CRU
~~~

`CRU TS`_
data provided by the Climatic Research Unit of the University of East Anglia.
If asked to do so, OGGM will automatically download and unpack the
latest dataset from the CRU servers.

.. _CRU TS: https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/

To download CRU data you can use the
following convenience functions:

.. code-block:: python

    from oggm.shop import cru
    cru.get_cl_file()
    cru.get_cru_file(var='tmp')
    cru.get_cru_file(var='pre')

.. warning::

    While the downloaded zip files are ~370mb in size, they are ~5.6Gb large
    after decompression!

The raw, coarse (0.5°) dataset is then downscaled to a higher resolution grid
(CRU CL v2.0 at 10' resolution [New_et_al_2002]_) following the anomaly mapping approach
described by Tim Mitchell in his `CRU faq`_ (Q25). Note that we don't expect
this downscaling to add any new information than already available at the
original resolution, but this allows us to have an elevation-dependent dataset
based on a presumably better climatology. The monthly anomalies are computed
following [Harris_et_al_2010]_ : we use standard anomalies for temperature and
scaled (fractional) anomalies for precipitation.

ERA5 and CERA-20C
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since OGGM v1.4, users can also use reanalysis data from the ECMWF, the
European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts based in Reading, UK.
OGGM can use the
`ERA5 <https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5>`_ (1979-2019, 0.25° resolution) and
`CERA-20C <https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/cera-20c>`_  (1900-2010, 1.25° resolution)
datasets as baseline. One can also apply a combination of both, for example
by applying the CERA-20C anomalies to the reference ERA5 for example
(useful only in some circumstances).

**When using these data, please refer to the original provider:**

HISTALP
~~~~~~~

OGGM can also automatically download and use the data from the `HISTALP`_
dataset (available only for the European Alps region, more details in [Chimani_et_al_2012]_.
The data is available at 5' resolution (about 0.0833°) from 1801 to 2014.
However, the data is considered spurious before 1850. Therefore, we
recommend to use data from 1850 onwards.

Any other climate dataset
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is fairly easy to force OGGM with other datasets too. Recent publications have used
plenty of options, from ERA5-Land to regional reanalyses or more.


GCM data
~~~~~~~~

OGGM can also use climate model output to drive the mass balance model. In
this case we still rely on gridded observations (e.g. W5E5) for the reference
climatology and apply the GCM anomalies computed from a preselected reference
period. This method is often called the
`delta method <http://www.ciesin.org/documents/Downscaling_CLEARED_000.pdf>`_.

(`OGGM run with GCM tutorial <https://oggm.org/tutorials/master/notebooks/run_with_gcm.html>`_).
