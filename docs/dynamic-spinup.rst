Dynamic spinup
==============

OGGM offers an option for reconstructing the recent past of a glacier by using
a dynamic spinup. For this dynamic spinup, you can choose if you want to match
area OR volume at the RGI-date.

Further, this dynamic spinup can be combined
with a dynamic :math:`\mu ^{*}` calibration. This calibration also tries to
calibrate :math:`\mu ^{*}` to match geodetic MB data as described in
:doc:`mass-balance-2012-pergla`, but further takes a dynamically changing glacier
geometry into account.
