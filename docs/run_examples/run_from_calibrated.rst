1. Set-up a run with previously calibrated mass-balance
=======================================================

This example shows how to run the OGGM  model for a list of selected glaciers
(here, four). We use a previously calibrated list of :math:`t^*` for the
run, which means that we don't have to calibrate the mass balance anymore.

For this example we download the list of glaciers from Fabien's dropbox, but
you can use any list of glaciers for this. See the
`prepare_glacier_list.ipynb <https://github.com/OGGM/oggm/blob/master/docs/notebooks/prepare_glacier_list.ipynb>`_
notebook in the ``oggm/docs/notebooks`` directory for an example on how to
prepare such a file.


Script
------

.. literalinclude:: _code/run_from_calibrated.py

If everything went well, you should see an output similar to::


    2017-08-02 18:09:29: oggm.cfg: Parameter file: /home/mowglie/Documents/git/oggm-official/oggm/params.cfg

.. note::

   During the ``random_glacier_evolution`` task some numerical warnings might
   occur. These are expected to happen and are caught by the solver, which then
   tries a more conservative time stepping scheme.

.. note::

    The ``random_glacier_evolution`` task can be replaced by any climate
    scenario built by the user. For this you'll have to develop your own task,
    which will be the topic of another example script.


Starting from a preprocessed state
----------------------------------

Now that we've gone through all the preprocessing steps once and that their
output is stored on disk, it isn't necessary to re-run everything to make
a new experiment. The code can be simplified to:

.. literalinclude:: _code/run_from_calibrated_and_prepro.py

.. note::

    Note the use of the ``filesuffix`` keyword argument. This allows to store
    the output of different runs in different files, useful for later analyses.


Some analyses
-------------

The output directory contains the compiled output files from the run. The
``glacier_characteristics.csv`` file contains various information about each
glacier obation after the preprocessing, either from the RGI directly
(location, name, glacier type...) or from the model itself (hypsometry,
inversion model output...).

Here is an example of how to read the file:

.. code-block:: python

    from os import path
    import pandas as pd
    WORKING_DIR = path.join(path.expanduser('~'), 'tmp', 'OGGM_precalibrated_run')
    df = pd.read_csv(path.join(WORKING_DIR, 'glacier_characteristics.csv'))
    print(df)

Output (reduced for clarity):

The run outpout is stored in netCDF files, and it can therefore be read with
any tool able to read those (Matlab, R, ...).

I myself am familiar with python, and I use the xarray package to
read the data:

.. literalinclude:: _code/example_analysis_ts.py

This code snippet should produce the following plot:

.. figure:: ../_static/run_example.png
    :width: 100%

.. warning::

    In the script above we have to "smooth" our length data for nicer plots.
    This is necessary because of annual snow cover: indeed, OGGM cannot
    differentiate between snow and ice. At the end of a cold mass-balance year,
    it can happen that some snow remains at the tongue and below: for the
    model, this looks like a longer glacier... (this cover is very thin, so
    that it doesn't influence the volume much).

More analysis
-------------

Here is a more complex example to demonstrate how to plot the glacier
geometries after the run:

.. literalinclude:: _code/example_analysis_maps.py

Which should produce the following plot:

.. figure:: ../_static/example_run_map_plot.png
    :width: 100%
