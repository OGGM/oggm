How to issue an OGGM release.

1. Ensure your master branch is synced to upstream:
       git pull upstream master
 2. Look over whats-new.rst and the docs. Make sure "What's New" is complete
    (check the date!) and add a brief summary note describing the release at the
    top.
 3. If you have any doubts, run the full test suite one final time!
      pytest --run-slow --mpl .
 4. On the master branch, commit the release in git:
      git commit -a -m 'Release v1.X.Y'
 5. Tag the release:
      git tag -a v1.X.Y -m 'v1.X.Y'
 6. Build source and binary wheels for pypi:
      git clean -xdf  # this deletes all uncommited changes!
      python setup.py bdist_wheel sdist
 7. Use twine to register and upload the release on pypi. Be careful, you can't
    take this back!
      twine upload dist/oggm-1.X.Y*
    You will need to be listed as a package owner at
    https://pypi.python.org/pypi/oggm for this to work.
 8. Push your changes to master:
      git push upstream master
      git push upstream --tags
 9. Update the stable branch (used by ReadTheDocs) and switch back to master:
      git checkout stable
      git rebase master
      git push upstream stable
      git checkout master
    It's OK to force push to 'stable' if necessary.
    We also update the stable branch with `git cherrypick` for documentation
    only fixes that apply the current released version.
10. Add a section for the next release (v.X.(Y+1)) to doc/whats-new.rst.
11. Commit your changes and push to master again:
      git commit -a -m 'Revert to dev version'
      git push upstream master
    You're done pushing to master!
12. Issue the release on GitHub. Click on "Draft a new release" at
    https://github.com/OGGM/oggm/releases. Type in the version number, but
    don't bother to describe it -- we maintain that on the docs instead.
13. Update the docs. Login to https://readthedocs.org/projects/oggm/versions/
    and switch your new release tag (at the bottom) from "Inactive" to "Active".
    It should now build automatically.
14. Issue the release announcement!
